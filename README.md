# fancy-text
A simple Python program to convert your text to Unicode fonts that work anywhere. 

## Fonts:
- 𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱
- 𝘐𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘤
- 𝘽𝙤𝙡𝙙 𝙄𝙩𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙘
- Ｍｏｎｏｓｐａｃｅｄ
- Typewriter
- 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐟
- 𝓗𝓪𝓷𝓭𝔀𝓻𝓲𝓽𝓲𝓷𝓰
- 𝕱𝖔𝖗𝖒𝖆𝖑
- 🇧 🇱 🇺 🇪 (this is uppercase-only!)
- 🅂🅀🅄🄰🅁🄴🄳 (also uppercase-only)
- 🅒🅘🅡🅒🅛🅔🅓 (also uppercase-only)



## Character support:
Bold, italic and bold italic fonts support all letters, both upper-case and lower-case, and all numerals.
The monospaced font supports a wide range of characters, including upper-case and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols such as .,!()[]#/
Typewriter and Serif only support the same characters as bold, italic and bold italic. Same for Handwriting and Formal.
Blue, Squared and Circled only support uppercase letters.


## Found a new font?
Please leave all the Unicode characters in an issue. I will implement the font.
